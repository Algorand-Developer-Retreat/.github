# Algorand Developer Retreat 2025

## Welcome 

I am thrilled to invite you to participate in an open event to collaborate on open-source code that moves the Algorand technology ecosystem forward. This is not a "hackathon" in the typical sense that people & teams compete with each other while building in secret until a final judging process--quite the opposite. This event is about working openly to solve problems, create proofs of concept, and push the envelope of what all Algorand developers can do. You can build an end-user product, general-purpose library, specialized developer tool, or infrastructure demonstration. The only rule is that all submissions are for the whole community, so they will live here as public repositories under the MIT License for the benefit of everyone.

## Submission Instructions

All members of this organization may create repositories for submissions. Great submissions will have a few components, but there are no strict rules, and nothing is being judged:
1. A README file with context about the submission, including a problem statement and how this problem was solved
2. The code itself and any related artifacts
3. A summary presentation or video explaining what was created

You will not have the ability to make submissions private or delete repositories, so just be sure that any work submitted is safe to share openly and permanently.
