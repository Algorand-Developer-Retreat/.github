# Algorand Developer Retreat 2025

## Welcome 

I am thrilled to invite you to an open event to collaborate on open-source code that moves the Algorand technology ecosystem forward. This is not a "hackathon" in the typical sense that people and teams compete with each other while building in secret until a final judging process—quite the opposite. 

This event is about working openly to solve problems, create proofs of concept, and push the envelope of what all Algorand developers can do. You can build an end-user product, general-purpose library, specialized developer tool, or infrastructure demonstration. 

The primary rule is that all submissions are for the whole community, so they will live here as public repositories under the MIT License for everyone’s benefit. This is not a competitive event, and submissions are not being judged, ranked, or scored in any way. 

Finally, don't be afraid to work on a topic just because someone else is, too--creative problem-solving benefits from taking divergent approaches, and everything is additive.

## Submission Instructions

All members of this organization may create repositories for submissions. Please include the following components:
1. A README file with context about the submission, including a description of the problem statement, how this problem was solved, and a clear description of what has been created.
2. All of the code, of course, and any related artifacts related to the solution, proof-of-concept, or demonstration.
3. On-site submissions should prepare a 3-minute presentation using [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBuDQ9OPL1gimr8N-qiVxPpg2a0dd0b6utkcy7jyO44/edit?usp=sharing). Remote submissions can include a presentation or video explaining what was created.

You will not be able to delete repositories or make them private, so please ensure that any work submitted is safe to share openly and permanently.
